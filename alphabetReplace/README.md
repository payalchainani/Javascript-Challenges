## ALPHABET REPLACE

Implement a function that accepts a string of any length, and replaces each letter within each word with the corresponding index that that letter has in the alphabet.

You must have a space between each index number, and do NOT need to account extra for spaces between words.

## Examples

```javascript
alphabetReplace('code');
    --> '3 15 4 5'

alphabetReplace('Northcoders');
    --> '14 15 18 20 8 3 15 4 5 18 19'

alphabetReplace('expert programming'); 
    --> '5 24 16 5 18 20 16 18 15 7 18 1 13 13 9 14 7'
```
