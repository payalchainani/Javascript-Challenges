## Change Assistant

The challenge is to implement a function that calculates the coins you would use to give a customer their change in a shop. The function takes one arguments, which is the amount of change needed, in pence. The function should always return an object.

```javascript
    changeCalculator(2);
    // {'2':1}
```

```javascript

    // -> {'5':1,'2':1}
```

```javascript
    calculateDivisors(13);
