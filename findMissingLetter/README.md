# Find Missing Letter

In this task, you need to find out which letter is missing. But you can't use a reference lookup table (i.e. no array or object with the whole alphabet in it) so you will have think outside the box!

This function needs to take a list and needs to return the letter it is missing.

You will always get a valid array. And it will be always exactly one letter be missing.
The length of the array will always be at least 2.
The array will always contain letters in only one case.

You can use these examples to start building up your test suite:

```
findMissingLetter(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'])
  // -> ''
```

```
findMissingLetter(['A', 'B', 'C', 'E'])
  // -> 'D'
```

```
findMissingLetter(['e', 'f', 'g', 'i'])
  // -> 'h'
```
