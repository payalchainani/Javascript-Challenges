## Herd the babies

Write a function called herdTheBabies which takes a string as its argument. The string will consist of several 'baby' (lowercase) letters, that belong to a 'parent' (uppercase) letter. 

The function should return a string that is sorted alphabetically, with the parent letter coming before its babies. 

EXAMPLES: 

```javascript
herdTheBabies('aA') //should return 'Aa'
```


```javascript
herdTheBabies('aBA') //should return 'AaB'
```


```javascript
herdTheBabies('bbaBccAC') //should return 'AaBbbCcc'
```
